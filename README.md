unified-raster

*Project is still in progress* 

The mission of the project is to enable the user to unify rasters on very simple web map application.
The map will have a resource manager which contain all the rasters divided to groups. 
The user will be able to change their visibility, order, opacity or crop them as he wish.
The map will show only thumbnails of the rasters because rasters are heavy and we want to achive great performance.
In the end of the proccess his choices will be save and he will be able to use the new unified raster.

Right now the data about the rasters is mock data and recieved from a simple express.js server that only sends the mock data.

For any further questions you can either open an issuse or send me an email :)
